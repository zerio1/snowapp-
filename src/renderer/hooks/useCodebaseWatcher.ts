 * Lifecycle:
 * 1. When `enabled` becomes true (and projectId/projectPath are set), the
 *    watcher is started AND an initial sync is triggered to catch changes
 *    that happened while the app was closed (offline changes).
 * 2. When the watcher fires a `files-changed` event (after the 3s Rust
 *    debounce), an incremental sync is automatically triggered.
 * 3. The sync compares files on disk with indexed files: deletes vectors for
 *    removed files, embeds new/changed files, skips unchanged files.
 * 4. While a sync is running, subsequent `files-changed` events are
 *    coalesced — only one sync runs at a time. If another change arrives
 *    during sync, another sync is queued to run after the current one.
 * 5. When `enabled` becomes false or the project changes, the watcher is
 *    stopped and the status resets to `idle`.
 *
 * The watcher and sync both run in the Rust backend (notify crate + tokio
 * runtime). This hook only manages the IPC subscription and React state.
