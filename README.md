## Overview

Snow App is a developer-focused desktop application that integrates AI-powered chat, terminal emulation, SSH remote management, Git tooling, and a built-in browser panel into a single unified workspace. It leverages a Rust native module for performance-critical operations such as SQLite storage, AI streaming, file watching, and HTTP requests.

Codex compatibility imports are started manually from the Codex compatibility
entry in Settings; the app does not synchronize Codex files during startup.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18
- **Rust** (stable toolchain) - required for building the native module
- **Cargo** - comes with Rust

### Platform-Specific

- **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools
- **Windows**: Visual Studio Build Tools (C++ workload)
- **Linux**: `build-essential`, `pkg-config`, and system SQLite (or use bundled)

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the Electron app in development mode with hot module replacement.

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This compiles the Rust native module and bundles the Electron application via electron-vite.

### Package for Windows

```bash
npm run build:win
```

This builds the app and produces NSIS and portable packages via electron-builder. Output is written to `dist/`.

### Type Checking

```bash
npm run check
```

Runs both TypeScript type checking (`tsc --noEmit`) and Rust checking (`cargo check`).

## Available Scripts

| Script               | Description                            |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`        | Start development server with HMR      |
| `npm run build`      | Build Rust native module + Vite bundle |
| `npm run build:win`  | Build + create Windows packages        |
| `npm run build:rust` | Build only the Rust native module      |
| `npm run check`      | TypeScript + Rust type checking        |
| `npm run check:ts`   | TypeScript type checking only          |
| `npm run preview`    | Preview the production build           |

## Native Module

The Rust native module (`snow_native`) is compiled to a Node addon (`.node`) via napi-rs. It provides:

- **AI API streaming** - Async streaming via reqwest and provider adapters for OpenAI Chat/Responses, Anthropic, and Gemini protocols
- **SQLite storage** - Embedded database via rusqlite for settings and chat history
- **File watching** - File system monitoring via the `notify` crate
- **HTTP client** - Full-featured HTTP client via reqwest with compression support
- **MCP protocol** - Model Context Protocol implementation
