## 1. Technology Stack

| Layer    | Technology                             | Primary responsibilities                                                  |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Renderer | React 19, TypeScript, Vite             | UI, conversation state, main agent loop, authorization UX                 |
| Preload  | Electron contextBridge                 | Flattens 16 API objects into controlled `window.snow.*` methods           |
| Main     | Electron 37, TypeScript                | Lifecycle, IPC orchestration, windows, PTY/SSH, browser, plugins, updates |
| Native   | Rust, napi-rs, Tokio                   | Provider adapters, MCP, SQLite, checkpoints, codebase indexing            |
| Storage  | SQLite, file system                    | `~/.snowapp/snowapp.db`, resource files, and multiple config domains      |
| Build    | electron-vite, Cargo, electron-builder | Three-entry bundling and platform-native `.node` artifacts                |

## 2. Layered Architecture

```mermaid

    renderer["Renderer: React UI and agent loop\nsrc/renderer"]
    preload["Preload: contextBridge\nsrc/preload"]
    main["Main: Electron orchestration\nsrc/main"]
    gate["nativeBridge Proxy\nstorageReady gate"]
    native["Native: Rust capabilities\nnative/src"]
    stores["SQLite and file systems"]

    renderer -->|"window.snow.*"| preload
    preload -->|"IPC invoke and events"| main
    main --> gate
    gate -->|"napi-rs"| native
    native --> stores
```

- The renderer has no Node access; system capabilities must use preload's allowlisted APIs.
- Main owns Electron resources and cross-layer orchestration, not SQLite connections.
- Rust owns provider streams, MCP execution, persistence, and file checkpoints.
- The main agent state machine lives in renderer `useAgentLoop.ts`; `native/src/exports/engine.rs` is one capability export, not the sole complete loop.

## 3. Communication Chains

### 3.1 Ordinary request: renderer to storage

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as React component
    participant P as Preload API
    participant IPC as Main IPC handler
    participant G as nativeBridge gate
    participant R as Rust export and service
    participant DB as SQLite

    UI->>P: window.snow.listChatConversations
    P->>IPC: ipcRenderer.invoke
    IPC->>G: native method
    G->>G: await storageReady
    G->>R: napi-rs call
    R->>DB: rusqlite query
    DB-->>UI: serialized result through the same chain
```

`src/preload/index.ts` currently combines **17 flat API objects**: `apiConfigApi`, `configApi`, `conversationApi`, `workspaceApi`, `sshApi`, `gitApi`, `systemApi`, `ptyApi`, `windowApi`, `memoApi`, `memoryApi`, `personalizationApi`, `codexApi`, `importConfigApi`, `pluginsApi`, `imageLibraryApi`, and `ideApi`. Methods live directly under `window.snow`; types are in `src/preload/types/`.

### 3.2 The storageReady gate

`loadNativeBridge()` loads `native/index.cjs` and retains the raw binding. The Proxy returned for normal calls waits for `storageReady`. Bootstrap initialization must use `getRawNative()`; otherwise initialization would wait for itself and deadlock.

### 3.3 AI streaming events

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant AL as Renderer useAgentLoop
    participant P as apiConfigApi
    participant H as chatHandlers
    participant R as Rust provider adapter

    AL->>P: createResponseStream request
    P->>P: create streamId and register chunk listener
    P->>H: invoke chat:create-response-stream
    H->>R: native.createResponseStream
    loop Provider chunks
        R-->>H: napi callback
        H-->>P: safeSend with streamId and chunk
        P-->>AL: filter streamId and call onChunk
    end
    R-->>AL: final response through invoke result
```

`src/main/app/sessionProxy.ts` only configures Electron `session` network proxies so `net.fetch`, webviews, and updater traffic follow proxy settings. It does not relay AI tokens or tool events.

## 4. Agent Runtime and Rust Capability Split

Renderer `runAgentLoop` maintains per-conversation `runId`, `streamId`, abort/pause state, and queued messages. Each round requests the model, parses `toolCallsJson`, runs authorization and Hooks, invokes tools, and passes `toolResultsJson` into the next round. It stops when no tool call remains; multiple conversations can continue independently in the background.

Rust `api/conversation/stream.rs` dispatches by `request_method` to four protocols: OpenAI Chat Completions, OpenAI Responses, Anthropic Messages, and Google Gemini. Each adapter builds payloads, converts normalized history, parses streaming events, accumulates text/thinking/tool calls/usage, and persists the round. Cross-provider tool-history conversion is centralized in `api/conversation/tool_messages.rs`.

## 5. Main and Native Modules

### 5.1 Main

`src/main/ipc/registerIpcHandlers.ts` is the authoritative IPC registration list and currently registers **20 groups**: PTY, native, API config, chat, config, conversation, workspace, IDE, SSH, Git, window, notification, memo, memory, personalization, Codex, import config, image, image library, and browser password. `browserNetworkRecorder`, `browserStorageState`, and `browserTrace` are support modules, not registration groups.

| Area                      | Responsibility                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app/`                    | Bootstrap, windows, protocols, tray, network proxy, storageReady |
| `ipc/handlers/`           | Validation and business orchestration                            |
| `native/`                 | Binding load, types, and storage gate                            |
| `pty/`, `ssh/`            | Local terminals and remote workspaces                            |
| `browser/`                | Webview popups and browser support                               |
| `plugins/`                | Isolated utility-process plugin runtime                          |
| `importConfig/`, `codex/` | Third-party discovery, selective import, reversible commit       |
| `updater/`                | Platform update flows                                            |

### 5.2 Native

`native/src/exports/` currently has 13 `.rs` files: `api.rs`, `checkpoint.rs`, `codebase.rs`, `engine.rs`, `git.rs`, `ide.rs`, `images.rs`, `mod.rs`, `sample.rs`, `sphere_layout.rs`, `storage.rs`, `terminal.rs`, and `updater.rs`.

The direct batch in `native/src/storage/database.rs::create_schema` creates 21 tables, followed by `image_library::ensure_image_library_table`; the current core business schema is therefore **22 tables including `image_library`**. Codebase indexing also creates auxiliary or per-project dynamic tables. `storage/services/` currently contains **36 service implementation modules plus `mod.rs`**.

The **15 fixed-order built-in MCP services** are filesystem, bash, todo, grep, websearch, browser, user_interaction, sub_agents, codebase, codelens, app_control, config, terminal, imagegen, and memory. Their order stabilizes the model tool array and prompt cache. The Skills tool is injected dynamically by `SkillsService`; `remote_workspace.rs` supports SSH and is not one of the 15 services.

## 6. Startup Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant E as Electron bootstrap
    participant W as Main window
    participant I as IPC and browser support
    participant N as Raw native binding
    participant S as Application services

    E->>E: set Chromium switches and scheme privileges
    E->>E: acquire single-instance lock and set app identity
    E->>E: app.whenReady and register protocols
    E->>W: create window first for boot loader
    E->>E: init tray and sync built-in skills and docs
    E->>I: register 19 IPC groups and browser support
    W-->>E: did-finish-load
    E->>N: getRawNative
    E->>S: initializeApplicationServices
    S->>S: initialize storage and migrations
    S->>S: cancel stale running sub-agents
    S->>S: ensure active default workspace and disable request log
    S->>S: markStorageReady
    E->>E: apply network proxy and persisted theme
```

The window is created first; heavy native loading and storage initialization wait until the first page load. Normal native calls queue at the gate, while initialization itself bypasses it.

## 7. One AI Conversation

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant L as Renderer agent loop
    participant M as Rust model adapter
    participant D as SQLite
    participant A as Authorization and Hooks
    participant T as Rust MCP tools

    U->>L: send message
    L->>L: create checkpoint and run onUserMessage
    loop Model and tool rounds
        L->>M: stream normalized context
        M-->>L: text, thinking, tool calls, usage
        M->>D: store chat exchange and usage
        alt Tool calls exist
            L->>A: toolConfirmation and user policy
            A-->>L: allow or deny
            L->>T: beforeToolCall then call_mcp_tool
            T-->>L: masked tool result
            L->>A: afterToolCall
            L->>L: build toolResultsJson
        else No tool calls
            L->>L: finish or consume queued user message
        end
    end
    L->>L: run onStop and refresh UI state
```

Checkpoints are supplemented around tool calls. Plan Mode, sub-agent allowed-tools, and sensitive bash authorization also have Rust-side enforcement. Parallel image generation and parallel sub-agents use dedicated orchestration and must not be modeled as universally serial tool execution.
